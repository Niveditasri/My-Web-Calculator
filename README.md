## Web Calculator Project Using Java Spring
## Project Overview
The Web Calculator project is a simple yet functional application developed using Java Spring framework. This project provides users with an online tool to perform basic arithmetic calculations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Key Features
User Interface:

A clean and intuitive web interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Input fields for entering numbers and selecting arithmetic operations.
A display area for showing the results of the calculations.
Backend Logic:

A Spring Boot application to handle the server-side logic.
RESTful API endpoints for performing calculations.
Services to process the arithmetic operations.
Security:

Basic input validation to ensure users enter valid numbers.
Error handling to manage invalid operations (e.g., division by zero).
Deployment:

Deployable on cloud platforms such as AWS or Heroku for accessibility.
Implementation Details
Frontend:

Create a user interface with HTML forms to capture user inputs.
Use JavaScript for dynamic interactions and to send requests to the backend.
Backend:

Set up a Spring Boot application with dependencies for web development.
Create a controller with endpoints for each arithmetic operation (e.g., /add, /subtract).
Implement service classes that contain the logic for performing calculations.
Validation and Error Handling:

Implement validation logic to check for valid input numbers.
Add exception handling for arithmetic errors like division by zero.
Testing:

Write unit tests for service methods to ensure accuracy of calculations.
Perform integration tests to verify the interaction between the frontend and backend.
